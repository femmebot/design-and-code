        <h1>The Raven</h1>
        <p>
          There was once a Queen and she had a little daughter, who was as yet a babe in arms; and once the child was so restless that the mother could get no peace, do what she would; so she lost patience, and seeing a flight of ravens passing over the castle, she opened the window and said to her child, &ldquo;Oh, that thou wert a raven and couldst fly away, that I might be at peace.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          No sooner had she uttered the words, than the child was indeed changed into a raven, and fluttered from her arms out of the window. And she flew into a dark wood and stayed there a long time, and her parents knew nothing of her. Once a man was passing through the wood, and he heard the raven cry, and he followed the voice; and when he came near it said, &ldquo;I was born a King&rsquo;s daughter, and have been bewitched, but thou canst
set me free.&rdquo; &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; asked the man.
